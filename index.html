    <div class="Intro">
        <p>I get no kick from champagne<p>
        <p>Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all<p>
        <p>So tell me why shouldn't it be true?<p>
        <p>I get a kick out of brew<p>
    </div>
    <div class="Verses">
        <p>There's only one beer left<p>
        <p>Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf<p>
        <p>Tempt me, do a number on the label<p>
        <p>Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table<p>
        <p>Like, "It's on me, put it on my tab, kid"<p>
        <p>However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it<p>
        <p>You're leaving on your face, forfeit<p>
        <p>I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it<p>
        <p>Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it<p>
        <p>She told him, "Get off it", and a bunch of other more shit<p>
        <p>Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads<p>
        <p>It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds<p>
        <p>It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off<p>
        <p>Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough<p>
        <p>They group been soft<p>
        <p>First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off<p>
        <p>He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road<p>
        <p>She asked him autograph her derriere, it read<p>
        <p>"To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd<p>
        <p>Love, Villain"<p>
        <p>Take pride in code words<p>
        <p>Crooked eye, mold, nerd geek with a cold heart<p>
        <p>Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart<p>
        <p>Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy<p>
        <p>No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye<p>
        <p>And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel<p>
        <p>The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel<p>
        <p>They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed<p>
        <p>"How there's only one left? The pack comes in six!<p>
        <p>Whatever happened to two and three?"<p>
        <p>A herb tried to slide with four and five<p>
        <p>And got caught like, "What you doing, G?<p>
        <p>Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy<p>
        <p>Matter of fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!"<p>
        <p>Looser than a pair of Adidas<p>
        <p>I hope you brought your spare tweeters<p>
        <p>MCs sound like cheerleaders<p>
        <p>Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin<p>
        <p>DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'<p>
        <p>He do it for the smelly hubbies<p>
        <p>Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies<p>
        <p>Few can do it, even fewer can sell it<p>
        <p>Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet<p>
        <p>He plots shows like robberies<p>
        <p>In and out, one, two, three, no bodies, please<p>
        <p>Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt<p>
        <p>The mic is the shotty, nobody move, nobody get hurt<p>
        <p>Bring heat like the boy done gone to war<p>
        <p>He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"<p>
        <p>A whole string of jobs like we on tour<p>
        <p>Every night on the score, coming to your corner store<p>
    </div>
    <div class="Outro">
        <p>There, it is done<p>
        <p>Now that the representative from South Africa has been<p>
        <p>Mind programmed<p>
        <p>All of the world leaders on Earth are under my control<p>
        <p>And when they meet tomorrow in special session<p>
        <p>I, DOOM, shall be voted "Master of the World"<p>
        <p>My plan is foolproof, but just in case<p>
        <p>And what about snow?<p>
        <p>Now, you keep your eyes open<p>
        <p>When I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)<p>
        <p>Uh, ladies and gentlemen<p>
        <p>I am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern<p>
        <p>That I must warn you, I, I<p>
        <p>You must listen<p>
        <p>Many among you, have, have had their minds taken over<p>
        <p>DOOM, gosh, I wish I'd brought my autograph book<p>
        <p>(Your attempts at humor bore me) Right, lead-head<p>
        <p>You're weird<p>
        <p>Why is everyone staring at us?<p>
        <p>(Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)<p>
        <p>Relax masseur, just do your thing<p>
        <p>(Get a good grip on my-)<p>
        <p>What? Why, I'll bend your read-out meter for ya, you little<p>
        <p>(Hey, knock it off, Ben)<p>
        <p>What's the matter? (Oh, Ben)<p>
        <p>You're nothing but a chicken-head<p>
        <p>(You overgrown granite-head) Hold it<p>
